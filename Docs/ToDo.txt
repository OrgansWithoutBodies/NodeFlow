make .GitIgnore file
get connections/module structure all working

    some widgets can be overridden by inputs
    FFT node
    Usable w/o gui
    Make signal its own object? - helpful to trace
    upload to github
    constrainable lengths (blegh) - rigidity value 0-1 as some half tangent fn
    Datasources as Ngons? Torminals on points as distinct dims of data 
    create new connected node on click 
    hold on edge/terminal adjusts/dels? connections
    selectbox
    have startup net (customizable)
    Node types - 
        Circles - 
            "scoots over" as more terminals added
        Polygons
            -fixed # of nodes
            -sources?
        Boxes (rounded)
            clear distinction between in/out
        
    
    ctrl T on several nodes makes total connection (undir?)
    Drag & drop for nodes - long press to move, short to highlight, doubleclick to edit?
    Edges go from term(interface) to term, not nodes to nodes
    place nodes from forces/etc
    generate net from adjmat
    order of selection
    sub?terminal STDev 
    encode strength in size/aspect in color
    simplex coloring - low opacity & stacks
    clean up code
    max num of nodes able to b added (1000? - editable)
    select two nodes then key combo to add edge between em  (j?e?f?f?)
    keycombo for new nodes (a?shifta?)
    deleteable/breakable (x)
    "show network metrics"
    processing nodes
        start @ sources (data/topological sense)
        
    cache (short+long?) calculated paths/subpaths to save time - need to figure out how to handle different ways of inputting new data
    have custom "group" node as object w cache checkbox? 
    make able to "act like singularities" for DS? 
    
    graphs: holoviews? 
    
    
    
    
@todo implement bokeh for web dashboard
@todo merge array node 
@todo SQL nodes - graphic automatically converts on detect, SELECT, WHERE, etc nodes? if implemented then single Pancakess

    #@todo fill in Pancakes sides better 
@todo signal path makes new threads for parallelicity
